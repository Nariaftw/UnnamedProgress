Remember to make new branches for any and all changes and do not change master directly.

Good GIT habits :D


The purpose of this repository is to play around with unity, and practice the skills we need for
the actual production of the game we want to produce.

It will grow naturally, but this can contain anything from unity project files, source code, designs/art
and so on.

Keep it as organized as you can, subfolders where possible, and it should work itself out.

Notes 		- 	For finalized notes used for reference, documents that are in flux will be on google drive.

Resources 	-	For any external resources we would like to keep track of (models, textures, etc.)

Unitysource	-	The actual working source of the project.
